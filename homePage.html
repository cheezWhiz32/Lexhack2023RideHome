        <p style="margin-top:30px;">How many times have you, a student, stayed late at school because you found out your bus<br>
             had been cancelled 5 minutes before school ended? Oddly specific, but probably more<br>
            times than you can count. Such is the condition in my town; there is so much miscommmunication between<br> 
            bus companies and schools that children have to deal with missed buses, hour long delays, and<br> 
            worst of all, rides home with the principal regularly. Ride Home is a platform intended to solve<br>
            this communication gap and make life easier for students. We connect schools and bus companies on a<br> 
            common platform so that rather than sending tedious emails back and forth, companies and schools can<br> 
            inform each other about updates a lot more efficiently.
